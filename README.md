How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my program is functional and secure, I make sure to fulfill all requirements and implement thorough testing using various strategies. I also followed proper naming conventions, commenting as needed, and using the appropriate access modifiers.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Recording the user's needs via functional requirements is a crucial step in software development. This gives you a thorough understanding of how the program is expected to behave. With this information, I will outline the requirements and create UML diagrams to help organize and adhere to expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to first read over any information I've been given. This will help understand expectations. Once I am developing the program, I take an iterative approach. I start with the most important features first and run the program regularly as I go. Once the feature is tested and behaves appropriately, I will move on to the next. This helps minimize larger errors down the line. If an error pops up, I know it is most likely what I am currently working on.
